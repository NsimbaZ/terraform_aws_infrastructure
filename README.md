# AWS Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform
Author: Nsimba Zebedi

In this project, I build an AWS infrastructure as code (IaC) from scratch using Terraform to support a web application running on AWS EC2 instances.
I utilize different AWS services, such as VPC, EC2, EFS, EBS, IAM, S3, RDS, ALB, Autoscaling all via IaC with Terraform.
